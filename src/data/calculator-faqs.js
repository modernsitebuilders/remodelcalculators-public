      question: "What is a cubic yard of concrete?",
      answer: "A cubic yard is 27 cubic feet of concrete (3 feet × 3 feet × 3 feet). This is the standard measurement for ready-mix concrete delivery. One cubic yard weighs approximately 4,000 pounds and covers 81 square feet at 4 inches thick."
    },
    {
      question: "How many 80-lb bags of concrete do I need per cubic yard?",
      answer: "Each 80-lb bag yields approximately 0.6 cubic feet when mixed. One cubic yard requires 45 bags of 80-lb concrete mix. For 60-lb bags, which yield 0.45 cubic feet each, you need 60 bags per cubic yard."
    },
    {
      question: "What thickness should a concrete slab be?",
      answer: "IRC code requires 3.5 inches minimum for residential slabs-on-grade. Standard practice is 4 inches for garage floors, patios, and basement slabs. Driveways carrying passenger vehicles need 4-5 inches, increasing to 6 inches for RV and heavy truck traffic. Always verify local building code requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "Why add waste factor to concrete calculations?",
      answer: "ACI recommends 5-10% waste factor for spillage, over-excavation, uneven subgrade, and form irregularities. Simple rectangular slabs typically need 5-7% extra. Complex pours with multiple sections, steps, or difficult access require 10-15% waste factor."

  'deck-stain-calculator': [
    {
      question: "How much deck stain covers per gallon?",
      answer: "Solid stains cover 200-400 square feet per gallon. Semi-transparent stains have the widest range at 100-650 square feet per gallon depending on wood porosity. Clear sealers cover 250-350 square feet per gallon. Rough or weathered wood requires 20-50% more stain than smooth, new wood."
    },
    {
      question: "How many coats of deck stain should I apply?",
      answer: "Most deck stains require 2 coats for proper protection. Solid stains may achieve full coverage in 1-2 coats. Semi-transparent and clear sealers typically need 2 coats. Weathered or bare wood may require 3 coats for adequate penetration and protection."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between deck stain and sealer?",
      answer: "Solid stains provide opaque color like paint but allow wood texture to show. Semi-transparent stains add color while showing wood grain. Clear sealers provide UV and moisture protection without changing wood color. All types penetrate wood rather than forming a surface film."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I restain my deck?",
      answer: "Clear sealers need reapplication every 1-2 years. Semi-transparent stains last 2-3 years. Solid stains last 3-5 years. Factors affecting lifespan include sun exposure, foot traffic, climate, and wood type. Reapply when water no longer beads on the surface."

  'drywall-calculator': [
    {
      question: "What size drywall sheets should I use?",
      answer: "Standard 4×8 sheets (32 square feet) work for most walls. 4×12 sheets (48 square feet) reduce seams and are preferred for walls over 8 feet tall. Use 4×12 or 54-inch-wide sheets for ceilings to minimize butt joints. Longer sheets reduce finishing time but are harder to maneuver."
    },
    {
      question: "What thickness drywall do I need?",
      answer: "Standard walls use 1/2 inch drywall. Ceilings with 16-inch joist spacing use 1/2 inch; 24-inch spacing requires 5/8 inch per code. Fire-rated assemblies require 5/8 inch Type X. Moisture areas need 1/2 inch or 5/8 inch purple board or cement board."
    },
    {
      question: "How much joint compound do I need?",
      answer: "Plan for approximately 280 square feet of coverage per gallon per coat based on USG specifications. For a complete three-coat finish (tape coat, fill coat, finish coat), you'll need about 3 gallons per 280 square feet, or roughly 0.011 gallons per square foot total. A 1,000 square foot project requires approximately 11 gallons for all three coats."
    },
    {
      question: "Why calculate 10-15% waste for drywall?",
      answer: "Waste accounts for cuts around doors, windows, outlets, and corners. Simple rectangular rooms need 10% waste for walls. Ceilings require 14% waste (10% plus 4% for overhead installation difficulty). Complex layouts with angles, soffits, or many openings require 15% waste overall."

  'exterior-paint-calculator': [
    {
      question: "How much does exterior paint cover per gallon?",
      answer: "Smooth siding covers 350-400 square feet per gallon. Textured surfaces cover 250-300 square feet per gallon. Rough stucco or porous brick covers 200-300 square feet per gallon. Coverage depends on surface texture, porosity, and application method."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does primer cover per gallon?",
      answer: "Primers universally cover less than topcoats, standardizing at 200-300 square feet per gallon across all manufacturers regardless of surface type. This reduced coverage accounts for better penetration and surface sealing."
    },
    {
      question: "How many coats of exterior paint do I need?",
      answer: "Most exterior projects require 2 coats. Previously painted surfaces in good condition may need only 1 coat if using high-quality paint and similar colors. Bare wood, new siding, or dramatic color changes require 1 primer coat plus 2 finish coats."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I paint trim and siding separately?",
      answer: "Yes, calculate trim separately. Trim, fascia, and soffits use different paint types (often semi-gloss vs satin for siding). Trim typically requires 1-2 quarts per 500 square feet of siding. Doors and shutters are calculated individually as accent areas."
    }

  'fence-calculator': [
    {
      question: "What's the standard spacing for fence posts?",
      answer: "Standard fence post spacing is 8 feet on-center for most residential fences per IRC guidelines. Privacy fences may use 6-foot spacing for added strength. High-wind areas or tall fences (over 6 feet) require 6-foot spacing. Corner and gate posts need concrete footings regardless of soil type."
    },
    {
      question: "How deep should fence posts be buried?",
      answer: "Fence posts should be buried one-third of total post length (1/3 rule). A 6-foot fence requires 8-9 foot posts buried 2-3 feet deep. Frost line requirements vary by region: northern climates may require 42-48 inches depth, southern regions 18-24 inches per local codes."
    },
    {
      question: "How many pickets do I need per section?",
      answer: "For 8-foot sections with 5.5-inch pickets and 1-inch gaps, you need approximately 15 pickets. For 3.5-inch pickets with 2-inch gaps, you need 17-18 pickets. Tight-board fences (no gaps) require 17-18 boards per 8-foot section depending on board width."
    },
    {
      question: "How much concrete do I need per fence post?",
      answer: "Standard 4×4 posts in 8-inch diameter holes require approximately 0.15 cubic feet (1.5 bags) of concrete per post. 6×6 posts in 12-inch holes need 0.35 cubic feet (3-4 bags) per post. Corner and gate posts should use 50% more concrete for stability."

  'flooring-calculator': [
    {
      question: "Why add waste factor to flooring calculations?",
      answer: "Waste accounts for cuts, pattern matching, defective pieces, and future repairs. Straight installations in rectangular rooms need 5-7% waste. Diagonal patterns require 10-15% waste. Herringbone or chevron patterns need 15-20% waste per NWFA guidelines."
    },
    {
      question: "How is hardwood flooring sold and measured?",
      answer: "Hardwood is sold by square foot in varying plank widths (3-5 inches typically). Coverage is actual face width, not total board width. A 100 square foot room needs 107-110 square feet of hardwood including waste. Bundles vary by manufacturer but typically cover 20-25 square feet."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between laminate and vinyl coverage?",
      answer: "Laminate flooring is sold in boxes covering 15-30 square feet depending on plank size. Vinyl plank (LVP) comes in similar box sizes. Sheet vinyl is sold by square yard (9 square feet) in 6-12 foot widths. Both require similar waste factors: 5-10% for standard installations."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I calculate tile flooring with different sizes?",
      answer: "Calculate room square footage first, then add waste factor. 12×12 inch tiles (1 square foot each) are straightforward. 6×6 inch tiles cover 0.25 square feet each. Large format tiles (24×24) cover 4 square feet each. Standard tile installations require 10% waste; diagonal patterns need 15-20%."

  'interior-paint-calculator': [
    {
      question: "How much paint does one gallon cover?",
      answer: "One gallon covers 350-400 square feet per coat on smooth drywall per PCA standards. Textured walls cover 300-350 square feet per gallon. Bare drywall or dramatic color changes require 250-300 square feet per gallon for first coat due to higher absorption."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does primer cover per gallon?",
      answer: "Primers universally cover less surface area than topcoats, standardizing at 200-300 square feet per gallon across all manufacturers. This reduced coverage ensures proper sealing and adhesion on bare or previously unpainted surfaces."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I deduct doors and windows from calculations?",
      answer: "Deduct openings larger than standard door size (20 square feet). Small windows (15 square feet) are often not deducted as they offset areas missed in corners and edges. For large window walls, deduct 50% of opening area as a practical compromise between accuracy and paint waste."
    },
    {
      question: "How many coats of interior paint do I need?",
      answer: "Most interior projects need 2 coats for uniform coverage and durability. Light colors over white primer may need 1-2 coats. Dark or bold colors require 2-3 coats. New drywall needs 1 coat primer plus 2 finish coats per manufacturer recommendations."

  'mulch-calculator': [
    {
      question: "How deep should mulch be?",
      answer: "Standard mulch depth is 2-3 inches for most landscaping per Mulch & Soil Council recommendations. Pathways and high-traffic areas need 3-4 inches. New beds benefit from 3 inches initially. Annual top-dressing adds 1-2 inches. Depths over 4 inches can suffocate plant roots and retain excess moisture."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I convert cubic yards to bags of mulch?",
      answer: "One cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet. Standard 2 cubic foot bags: 13.5 bags per yard. Standard 3 cubic foot bags: 9 bags per yard. To calculate bags needed: multiply cubic yards by 13.5 for 2-cu-ft bags or by 9 for 3-cu-ft bags."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the 324 rule for mulch calculation?",
      answer: "The 324 rule states: 1 cubic yard covers 324 square feet at 1 inch deep. For 2 inches: divide by 2 (162 sq ft per yard). For 3 inches: divide by 3 (108 sq ft per yard). This provides quick estimates: a 100 sq ft bed at 3 inches needs approximately 0.93 cubic yards."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does a cubic yard of mulch weigh?",
      answer: "Dry hardwood mulch weighs 400-800 pounds per cubic yard. Dry bark mulch weighs 300-500 pounds per yard. Wet mulch weighs significantly more: 800-1,200 pounds per yard. Cedar mulch is lighter at 300-400 pounds per yard. Weight affects delivery costs and handling requirements."

  'roofing-calculator': [
    {
      question: "What is a roofing square?",
      answer: "One roofing square equals 100 square feet of roof surface. This is the standard industry measurement for estimating materials and labor. A 2,000 square foot roof equals 20 roofing squares. Most shingles are sold in bundles, with 3 bundles covering one roofing square."
    },
    {
      question: "How does roof pitch affect material calculations?",
      answer: "Roof pitch multiplies flat roof area to get actual surface area. A 6/12 pitch has a multiplier of 1.118. A 12/12 pitch multiplies by 1.414. Example: 1,000 sq ft footprint with 8/12 pitch (1.202 multiplier) requires 1,202 sq ft of shingles. Steeper roofs need proportionally more material."
    },
    {
      question: "How many bundles of shingles do I need?",
      answer: "Standard three-tab or architectural shingles come 3 bundles per square. Calculate total squares (including waste), then multiply by 3. A 25-square roof with 10% waste (27.5 squares) requires 83 bundles. Ridge cap shingles are calculated separately: 1 bundle per 30-33 linear feet of ridge."
    },
    {
      question: "What waste factor should I use for roofing?",
      answer: "NRCA recommends 10% waste for simple roofs with few penetrations. Complex roofs with valleys, dormers, or hips require 15% waste. Roofs with multiple angles, turrets, or irregular shapes need 15-20% waste. This accounts for cuts, starter strips, and ridge cap coverage."

  ],

  'siding-calculator': [
    {
      question: "How is siding coverage calculated?",
      answer: "Siding coverage depends on material type and installation method. Vinyl siding: 1 square = 100 sq ft actual coverage. Fiber cement lap: varies by plank width (6-12 inches). Board and batten: calculate board coverage minus gap spacing. Manufacturers provide exposure rates per piece or per box."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I deduct windows and doors from siding calculations?",
      answer: "Yes, deduct all window and door openings from total wall area. However, add back 5-10% for trim, corners, and waste. Large windows and garage doors significantly reduce siding needs. Multiply gable areas by 0.5 to approximate triangular area, or use height × width ÷ 2 for accuracy."
    },
    {
      question: "How much waste factor for siding?",
      answer: "Standard installations need 10% waste for cuts, corners, and trim. Complex layouts with multiple corners, angles, or architectural details require 15% waste. Diagonal or decorative patterns need 15-20% waste. Fiber cement has higher waste (12-15%) due to brittleness requiring careful cuts per ASTM C1186."
    },
    {
      question: "How many squares of siding do I need?",
      answer: "Calculate total wall square footage (length × height for each wall), deduct openings, add waste factor, then divide by 100 to get squares. Example: 2,000 sq ft of walls minus 300 sq ft openings = 1,700 sq ft. With 10% waste: 1,870 sq ft = 18.7 squares (round up to 19 squares)."
